1. Think about the last app you used on your phone. 📱 What are its core hardware, software, and data components? What problem does it solve for you? 🤔💡⚙️
    
    Hint: 從你常用的手機應用程式，思考它的組成要素與目的。
         App: Instagram (used to scroll through stories and posts).
         Core Components:
         Hardware: Smartphone (screen, camera, touch sensors, GPU for graphics rendering).
         Software: Instagram app, mobile OS (Android/iOS), backend servers (for hosting and managing data).
         Data: Photos, videos, stories, user interactions (likes, comments, follows), metadata (locations, timestamps).
         Problem Solved: Instagram helps me stay connected with friends, explore content, and stay informed about events, trends, and news in a visually engaging way. It essentially provides a social space to share and consume visual media.
    
2. Imagine you have to create a new information system for your favorite coffee shop. ☕️ How would it help the staff with their processes? Who are the key people who would use it? 👨‍🍳👩‍💻📈🤝
    
    Hint: 設想如何用一個系統幫助你常去的咖啡店，從流程和使用者角度切入。
         New Info System for a Coffee Shop:
         Purpose: To streamline operations from taking orders to inventory management.
         Key People:
         Baristas and Staff: They would use the system to manage orders, update item availability, and track sales.
         Managers: They would use it to manage inventory, monitor employee performance, and track daily sales data.
         Customers: Optionally, customers could use the app for pre-ordering or loyalty programs.
         How it Helps:
         Order Management: Track and manage orders in real-time (digital ticketing).
         Inventory Control: Automatically adjust stock levels as items are used or sold, with alerts for restocking.
         Sales Reporting: Provide analytics on sales, peak hours, popular products, and customer preferences.
         Customer Feedback: Integrate a simple feedback mechanism or reviews system for improving service.

3. The material says IS helps organizations gain a competitive advantage. 🏆 Can you think of a company that uses an IS so well it seems like their secret weapon? 🤫 What makes their system so special? 🚀✨🌟
    
    Hint: 舉一個你認為因資訊系統而特別成功的公司，並說明它的獨特之處。
         Company with a Great IS:
         Company: Amazon.
         Specialty of Their IS: Their entire ecosystem (e-commerce platform, AWS, supply chain management, recommendation engine) runs on a highly integrated and efficient Information System. The system’s ability to predict customer needs through advanced data analytics, its smooth integration across warehouses, and its swift delivery process (e.g., Amazon Prime) are key factors.
         Why It's Special: Amazon’s use of data-driven decision-making and real-time optimization of inventory, orders, and customer preferences gives them a major edge. It’s almost like their IS runs the entire business, allowing them to scale rapidly while maintaining a smooth, personalized shopping experience for users.
   
4. You're the "people" component of an IS. 🙋‍♂️ A new system is being implemented at your workplace, and it's making your job harder, not easier. 😫 What would you do? How would you communicate your concerns? 🗣️📝💬❓
    
    Hint: 如果新系統讓你工作更難，你會怎麼反應和溝通？
         My Response:
         Understand the Issue: First, I would identify which aspects of the system are making my job harder. Is it inefficient workflow? Lack of training? Clunky interface?
         Collect Evidence: I would document specific examples of where the system is causing issues (delays, mistakes, added complexity) to support my case.
         Communicate: Approach management or the IT team with clear, constructive feedback. Explain the issues, show how they affect productivity, and suggest potential improvements or alternative solutions.
         Offer Solutions: If possible, propose ways to adjust or improve the system (e.g., better training, interface improvements, or integrating features that make it easier to use).

5. What's one everyday problem you have that could be solved by a simple IS? 🤔 For example, managing your daily schedule or tracking your expenses. 🗓️ How would your proposed system work? 💡✍️📊
    
    Hint: 找出一個生活中的小問題，並發想如何用一個簡單的資訊系統解決它。
        Problem: Keeping track of my daily expenses and sticking to a budget.
        Proposed System:
        Simple Expense Tracker App: An app that automatically categorizes purchases based on receipt scanning or bank transactions. It would provide easy-to-read visuals (graphs, charts) showing my spending habits.
        Budget Alerts: The system would allow me to set a budget for different categories (food, entertainment, etc.), and notify me when I’m close to reaching or exceeding the limit.
        Goal Setting: It could also let me set saving goals (e.g., save $500 in 3 months) and track my progress. The system would help me make more conscious spending decisions by visualizing how small purchases add up.
